#### 1. In design Heuristics, what does the term “advantages of Matching between system and the real world” mean? What are the advantages?

*Matching between the system and the real world - this is the most widely used heuristic. The main idea of this one is to make the interaction process between the user and the system more comfortable and intuitive. It means using familiar-to-user language in the interface, representing objects on the website really like they are in the real world, using less specific terms and words, being simple and intuitive in design, and all information should be presented in a natural and logical way.
The advantages of this heuristic are that the user will get a successful experience, be happy, and build trust with this company. Applying this heuristic will help to get more loyal clients in future.*

#### 2. What do you understand by “Single source of truth”? and how does it relate to redux? What are the advantages?

*I understand it like something which is important is keeping in one place. In terms of Redux it sounds like this is one of 3 Redux fundamental principles. 
Advantages of this principle is in: 
-debugging(this becomes much easier  because you have one source of value)			
-serializing(you can serialize the app state to the client much easier and to the server as well)
-some generalized functionalities become easier to implement*

#### 3. What is the difference between a stateless component and a stateful  component in React?

*The difference is in: the stateless component is without a state(a functional component that takes props as an argument and returns a react element) , and the stateful is with a state(can change the state and pass it through the props to a child component).*

#### 4. List out the advantages and disadvantages of exploratory testing (used in Agile) and scripted testing? 

**Exploratory Testing:**

*List of adv:*

 - really good in finding problems with usability and UI;
 - through this testing owners can get insights that are not possible through other types of testing;
 - no need special time for preparation;
 - can show edge cases that can be used in future testing;


*List of disadv:*

 - almost no documentation for this process;
 - depends on the tester's skills and knowledge in the domain area;
 - can take more time than planned;
 - tester can easily steer off the plan;



**Scripted Testing:**

*List of adv:*

 - good level of documentation;
 - execution is faster;
 - can get more reliable results;
 - can test more things at one, that is increased scalability;
 - tests can run many times, because they can be automated;


*List of disadv:*

 - the complexity of the process;
 - feedback is slower;
 - it should be written for every new environment;
 - can test the functionality part of application, not GUI elements;
